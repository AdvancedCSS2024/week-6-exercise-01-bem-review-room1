## Example 23
> [!TIP]
> Let's assume that in some case it make sense to call a section "cat" or "dog", the section "cat" will consist of multiple cards of cats, and the section "dog" will consist of multiple cards of dogs. Let's not focuse here on BEM. Nevertheless, how could you improve on class naming?
> I am not sure... Since the sections should be called cat or dog, they need a section parent? like instead of class naming the section below this comment as "cat", it should be named: 

    <section class="section--cat">
        ...
    </section>
