# BEM in practice

## Part 1 - BEM
Below you can see examples of code and style from class exercises: 
- *Week 4 - Exercise 01 - Applying BEM and styling*
- *Week 5 - Exercise 01 - Inheritance and BEM* 

**Discuss** in groups of two below examples and **propose better solution** according to BEM principles if needed. 

If you need help feel free to use [BEM Naming Cheat Sheet](https://bem-cheat-sheet.9elements.com/) or discuss it on MS Teams -> Team: AdvancedCSS 2024 -> Channel: [General](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3AGcJsLef6WAE6qb-9gr01mLK-AJ8W7tCQaUsF15g5AJs1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=05ca134d-fae1-48db-b017-a4769681310d&tenantId=09a10672-822f-4467-a5ba-5bb375967c05)

## Part 2 - GitHub Collaboration
In addition to the above BEM exercise, in your group, practice Git collaboration:

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. One student takes exercises with even numbers, and the other student takes exercises with odd numbers.
3. Practice creating branches, pull requests, and merging.
4. Create a branch for each example.
5. Add your solution.
6. Create a Pull Request for that change.
7. Your colleague needs to approve your Pull Request.
8. Merge your changes into the "main" branch.
9. Repeat steps 4-8.
10. **Do not delete the Feedback branch.**
